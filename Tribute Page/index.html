        <p>
            Narendra Damodardas Modi, born on September 17, 1950, is an Indian politician serving as the 14th and current Prime Minister of India since May 2014. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer organization. Modi is widely regarded as one of the most influential leaders in Indian politics.

Modi was born in Vadnagar, a small town in Gujarat, India. He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Modi and Heeraben Modi. From a young age, Modi showed leadership qualities and was actively involved in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organization.

He completed his schooling in Vadnagar and later earned a Bachelor's degree in Political Science from the University of Delhi. Modi then went on to complete a Master's degree in Political Science from Gujarat University.

Narendra Modi's political career began in the early 1970s when he joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He quickly rose through the ranks of the organization and became a prominent leader. In 1987, he joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and was appointed as the General Secretary of the party's Gujarat unit.

Modi's big break came in 2001 when he was appointed as the Chief Minister of Gujarat following the resignation of Keshubhai Patel. He went on to serve as the Chief Minister for three consecutive terms, making him one of the longest-serving Chief Ministers in the history of Gujarat.

In 2014, Narendra Modi led the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to a historic victory in the general elections, securing a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India's Parliament. He was subsequently sworn in as the Prime Minister of India, succeeding Manmohan Singh.

As Prime Minister, Modi has implemented several ambitious initiatives aimed at boosting economic growth, improving infrastructure, and promoting social welfare. Some of his notable initiatives include:

Make in India: A campaign to encourage multinational and domestic companies to manufacture their products in India.
Swachh Bharat Abhiyan: A nationwide cleanliness campaign aimed at eliminating open defecation and improving sanitation.
Digital India: An initiative to promote digital literacy, digital infrastructure, and digital services across the country.
Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana: A financial inclusion program aimed at providing banking services to the unbanked population.
Modi has also been active on the international stage, seeking to strengthen India's ties with other countries and promote its interests globally. He has undertaken numerous foreign trips, engaging with world leaders and participating in various international forums.

One of the defining features of Modi's foreign policy has been his emphasis on "Neighborhood First," prioritizing India's relations with its neighboring countries. He has also sought to deepen ties with major powers such as the United States, Russia, and China, while also enhancing India's engagement with countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.
Narendra Modi's leadership has had a profound impact on India's political landscape and its standing in the world. Whether it is his ambitious economic reforms, his efforts to promote social welfare, or his active diplomacy on the global stage, Modi has emerged as a dynamic and influential leader who continues to shape India's future in significant ways.
